# CompleteAndroid

This project is a simulator of a real bank mobile application.

This is my first app in kotlin with Android jetpack, so it is going slow. I'm trying to apply architectural patterns (MVC- MVVM). 

I am trying to apply all the knowledge I have into this app, so it can be a template to do other kinds of apps. 

The way I see it, it is 10% completed (I'll try to update this percentage as I start adding features).
